<!-- React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building component-based user interfaces. It focuses on:

Declarative programming
Component reusability
Efficient DOM updates using a virtual DOM -->

<!-- Components are the building blocks of React apps.
 Two main types:
Function Components (modern, preferred)
Class Components (older)
 -->

 <!-- JSX (JavaScript XML) -->
<!-- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML but is used in React. -->

<!-- Babel is a JavaScript compiler — most commonly used to convert modern JavaScript (ES6/ESNext)
  and JSX into backward-compatible JavaScript that can run in older browsers or environments. -->

  <!-- Create React App

A traditional tool for bootstrapping React apps.
Uses Webpack under the hood.
Handles Babel, JSX, and React setup for you.
Heavier and slower on large projects (especially during dev/startup).

⚡ Vite

A modern, lightning-fast build tool.
Uses ES modules (ESM) and native browser support for development.
Uses Rollup under the hood for production builds.
MUCH faster dev experience — instant server start, hot module replacement (HMR), etc.
Supports JSX, TypeScript, and React via plugins. -->
